Above the login page, users, whether they are administrators or employees, can enter their respective login credentials to access the application. We have implemented a filtering mechanism that determines the role of the person attempting to authenticate. If the user is an admin, they will be directed to the admin section; otherwise, they will be redirected to the employee section
