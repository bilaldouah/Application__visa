Above the login page, users, whether they are administrators or employees, can enter their respective login credentials to access the application. We have implemented a filtering mechanism that determines the role of the person attempting to authenticate. If the user is an admin, they will be directed to the admin section; otherwise, they will be redirected to the employee section

In this section, employees can view a comprehensive list of all available services. There are a total of seven distinct services, and employees have the option to add any or all of these services to their view, enabling them to access and interact with each one seamlessly

In this section, employees can access a comprehensive overview of their payment history. However, in the provided example, the database is currently empty, resulting in the unavailability of any payment-related data

Employees have the option to recover their password in the event that they forget it. This can be achieved by entering their registered email address

Upon entering their email, they will receive a corresponding email containing a unique number. To proceed with the recovery process, they need to enter this number

Upon receiving the email, and after entering their unique number, employees can proceed to the next phase, where they will be prompted to enter a new password

This is the admin section, where data is presented in graphical format. As illustrated, administrators have the capability to filter the data using various parameters such as service type, agencies, date range (from and to), years, and additional options

If an agency is selected, administrators can access a comprehensive list of all the employees affiliated with that specific agency. Additionally, they have the option to exclusively view data associated with the chosen agency.

The same principle applies to agencies; if an employee is selected, administrators can access the data relevant to that particular employee

Administrators have the ability to review their incoming (money). Furthermore, they can apply filters based on specific dates or agencies to refine their view
